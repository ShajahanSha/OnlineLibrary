# Online Library Rest API

**Develop Rest APIâ€™s for**
 
    - CRUD operations on Books. 
    - Checkout operation for single or multiple books which will return the total payable amount.
	
    Considerations: 
    - You can use either Spring Boot or Quarkus 
    - Book object should have the following attributes: 
	    - Name 
	    - Description 
	    - Author 
	    - Type/Classification 
	    - Price ISBN 
    - Checkout method will take list of books as parameters plus optional promotion code and return total price after discount (if applicable). 
    - Promotion/Discounts is variant according to book type/classification, ex: fiction books may have 10% discount while comic books have 0% discount.
